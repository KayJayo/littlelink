     <h3 class="online">So about that editing</h3>
     <p class="para">I enjoy editing videos, in Davinci Resolve of course, non-professionally. I edit videos for friend groups and personal projects.</p>

     <h3 class="online">What I'm Playing</h3>
     <p class="para">I've mentioned before that I enjoy video games, here is a list and some reviews of every game I am completing/have completed.</p>
     <br>
     <br>
     <p class="para">Oneshot - I completed Oneshot for the first time on October 20th, and it was one of the most touching games I have played in recent memory, saying that I realize I havent completed many great games, Oneshot should be the 2nd of many to come.</p>
     <br>
     <p class="para">Half-Life - I know I'm a zoomer, completing the 2 main Half-Life games 20 years late. Both great games with great gameplay, would still recommend in 2024.</p>
     <br>
     <p class="para">Rain World - I haven't completed this fully yet, I have completed Survivor though, so I can say this with confidence. PLAY RAIN WORLD PLAY RAIN WORLD PLAY RAIN WORLD.</p>
     <br>
     <p class="para">Subnautica - Incredible in many aspects. Graphics, great. Gameplay, great. Sandbox, great. Mechanics, great. Story, I wasn't too invested in the story but could tell it was great. Music, fucking incredible.</p>
     <br>
     <p class="para">Celeste - Celeste was THE most touching game I have played thus far. Not for gender, not for depression, but the weight of reality and how much the game has relatability to seeing friends and others' experience with these things. Great gameplay, great story, ooh that pixel art is good, Lena Raine cooked with the music, mods are good, and so is this run-on sentence.</p>
     <br>
     <p class="para">And more! I might add more later. My steam account is on my links page.</p>
